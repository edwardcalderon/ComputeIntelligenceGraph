# Pipeline Connection Fixed ✅

## Issue
The CodePipeline was configured with an old CodeStar connection ARN that was no longer valid:
- **Old Connection**: `arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-2:520900722378:connection/github-cig`
- **Error**: "No Connection found with ARN: arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-2:520900722378:connection/github-cig"

## Solution
Updated the pipeline configuration to use the new, authorized CodeStar connection:
- **New Connection**: `arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-2:520900722378:connection/3ee9f8cd-a6b9-482c-8c41-109c277a4fae`

## Changes Made
1. Updated `packages/llm-proxy/infra.config.ts` to use `INFRA_CODESTAR_CONNECTION_ARN` from environment
2. Updated `.env` with the new connection ARN
3. Applied the pipeline update via AWS CLI:
   ```bash
   aws codepipeline update-pipeline --cli-input-json file:///tmp/pipeline_clean.json
   ```

## Verification
✅ Pipeline Source stage now successfully connects to GitHub
✅ Latest commit (335cbb8) fetched successfully
✅ Connection ARN verified in pipeline execution history

## Pipeline Execution Details
- **Execution ID**: d516de8d-345a-4e6a-ba30-713e9cb134fa
- **Source Stage**: ✅ Succeeded
- **Commit**: 335cbb8be712d7b410225e68b3b5abfdec2d96a6 (chore(llm-proxy): release v0.2.2)
- **Repository**: edwardcalderon/ComputeIntelligenceGraph
- **Branch**: main

## Next Steps
The pipeline is now ready to process commits. The Validate stage may have temporary CodeBuild queue limits, but the critical GitHub connection issue is resolved.

To trigger a new pipeline execution:
```bash
aws codepipeline start-pipeline-execution \
  --pipeline-name llm-proxy-production-pipeline \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --profile aws-cig
```

Or simply push a commit to the main branch to trigger automatically.
