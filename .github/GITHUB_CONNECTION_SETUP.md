# GitHub CodeStar Connection Setup

## Connection Created ✅

A CodeStar Connection has been created to enable AWS CodePipeline to access your GitHub repository.

### Connection Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Connection Name** | `github-cig` |
| **Connection ARN** | `arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-2:520900722378:connection/876488de-c75b-4f86-9e7d-2a268bf24e70` |
| **Provider** | GitHub |
| **Status** | PENDING (needs authorization) |
| **Account** | 520900722378 (CIG) |
| **Region** | us-east-2 |

## Authorization Steps

The connection needs to be authorized by connecting it to your GitHub account. Follow these steps:

### Option 1: AWS Console (Recommended)

1. Open AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/connections/
2. Select region: **us-east-2**
3. Find connection: **github-cig**
4. Click **Update pending connection**
5. Click **Connect to GitHub**
6. **IMPORTANT:** Leave "App Installation" field BLANK
   - Clear any app installation ID by clicking the X button
   - This allows you to connect as a GitHub user instead of a bot
7. You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize AWS
8. Click **Authorize AWS Connector for GitHub**
9. Grant permissions to access your repositories
10. Return to AWS Console - connection status should change to **AVAILABLE**

### Option 2: AWS CLI

```bash
# List pending connections
aws codestar-connections list-connections \
  --filter-criteria states=PENDING \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --profile aws-cig

# Get connection details
aws codestar-connections get-connection \
  --connection-arn arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-2:520900722378:connection/876488de-c75b-4f86-9e7d-2a268bf24e70 \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --profile aws-cig
```

## What Happens After Authorization

Once the connection is authorized:

1. **Pipeline Activation** - The CodePipeline will be ready to use
2. **GitHub Integration** - AWS can access your repository
3. **Automatic Triggers** - Pushes to `main` branch will trigger the pipeline
4. **Build & Deploy** - CodeBuild will automatically build and deploy your code

## Pipeline Trigger

After authorization, the pipeline will automatically trigger on:

- **Branch:** `main`
- **Event:** Push to repository
- **Action:** Starts Source → Validate → Build → Deploy stages

## Verify Connection Status

```bash
# Check if connection is AVAILABLE
aws codestar-connections get-connection \
  --connection-arn arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-2:520900722378:connection/876488de-c75b-4f86-9e7d-2a268bf24e70 \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --profile aws-cig
```

Expected output when authorized:
```json
{
    "Connection": {
        "ConnectionName": "github-cig",
        "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-2:520900722378:connection/876488de-c75b-4f86-9e7d-2a268bf24e70",
        "ProviderType": "GitHub",
        "OwnerAccountId": "520900722378",
        "ConnectionStatus": "AVAILABLE"
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Still Pending

If the connection remains in PENDING status:

1. Check GitHub OAuth app permissions
2. Verify your GitHub account has access to the repository
3. Try authorizing again through AWS Console

### Pipeline Not Triggering

If the pipeline doesn't trigger on push:

1. Verify connection status is AVAILABLE
2. Check that you're pushing to the `main` branch
3. Verify repository name and owner in pipeline configuration
4. Check CodePipeline execution history for errors

## Repository Configuration

The pipeline is configured to use:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Repository Owner** | `edwardcalderon` |
| **Repository Name** | `ComputeIntelligenceGraph` |
| **Branch** | `main` |
| **Connection** | `github-cig` |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ CodeStar Connection created
2. ⏳ **Authorize connection** (you are here)
3. Push code to `main` branch to trigger pipeline
4. Monitor pipeline execution in AWS Console
5. Verify Lambda deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "You don't have permission to create the connection"

**Cause:** An app installation ID is set that you don't have access to.

**Solution:**
1. Click the **X** button to clear the "App Installation" field
2. Leave it blank
3. This allows you to connect as a GitHub user instead of a bot
4. Try authorizing again

### Connection Still Pending

If the connection remains in PENDING status:

1. Check GitHub OAuth app permissions
2. Verify your GitHub account has access to the repository
3. Try authorizing again through AWS Console

1. Verify connection status is AVAILABLE
2. Check that you're pushing to the `main` branch
