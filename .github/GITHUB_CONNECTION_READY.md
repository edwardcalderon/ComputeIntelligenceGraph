---

## 🔐 How to Authorize (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open AWS Console
Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/connections/

### Step 2: Select Region
Make sure you're in region: **us-east-2**

### Step 3: Find Connection
Look for: **github-cig**

### Step 4: Update Connection
Click: **Update pending connection**

### Step 5: Connect to GitHub
Click: **Connect to GitHub**

### Step 6: Configure GitHub App (Important!)
- **App Installation field:** Leave BLANK
- This allows you to connect as a GitHub user instead of a bot
- If you see an app installation ID, clear it by clicking the X button

### Step 7: Authorize AWS
- You'll be redirected to GitHub
- Click: **Authorize AWS Connector for GitHub**
- Grant permissions to access your repositories

### Step 8: Verify
- Return to AWS Console
- Connection status should change to **AVAILABLE**

---

## ✅ Verify Authorization

Run this command to check if authorization is complete:

```bash
aws codestar-connections get-connection \
  --connection-arn arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-2:520900722378:connection/876488de-c75b-4f86-9e7d-2a268bf24e70 \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --profile aws-cig
```

**Expected output when authorized:**
```json
{
    "Connection": {
        "ConnectionName": "github-cig",
        "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-2:520900722378:connection/876488de-c75b-4f86-9e7d-2a268bf24e70",
        "ProviderType": "GitHub",
        "OwnerAccountId": "520900722378",
        "ConnectionStatus": "AVAILABLE"
    }
}
```

---

## 🚀 After Authorization

Once the connection is authorized:

1. **Pipeline Becomes Active**
   - Status changes from PENDING to AVAILABLE
   - Pipeline is ready to receive GitHub events

2. **Automatic Triggers**
   - Any push to `main` branch triggers the pipeline
   - Pipeline automatically runs all 4 stages

3. **Deployment Flow**
   ```
   GitHub Push (main)
        ↓
   CodePipeline Source Stage
        ↓
   CodeBuild Validate (lint, test, build)
        ↓
   CodeBuild Build (Docker build, ECR push)
        ↓
   CodeBuild Deploy (SST deploy, Lambda update)
        ↓
   Lambda Function Updated ✅
   ```

4. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Check AWS CodePipeline console
   - View logs in CloudWatch
   - Test API endpoints

## 📋 Pipeline Configuration

The pipeline is already configured with:

```
Source Stage:
  Provider: CodeStarSourceConnection
  Repository: edwardcalderon/ComputeIntelligenceGraph
  Branch: main
  Connection: github-cig (PENDING)

Validate Stage:
  Project: llm-proxy-production-validate
  Actions: lint, test, build

Build Stage:
  Project: llm-proxy-production-build-docker
  Actions: Docker build, ECR push

Deploy Stage:
  Project: llm-proxy-production-deploy
  Actions: SST deploy, Lambda update
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Connection Still Pending After Authorization

If the connection remains PENDING:

1. Check GitHub OAuth app permissions
2. Verify your GitHub account has access to the repository
3. Try authorizing again through AWS Console
4. Check GitHub OAuth app settings

### Pipeline Not Triggering

If the pipeline doesn't trigger on push:

1. Verify connection status is AVAILABLE
2. Check that you're pushing to the `main` branch
3. Verify repository name: `edwardcalderon/ComputeIntelligenceGraph`
4. Check CodePipeline execution history for errors

### Build Failures

If CodeBuild projects fail:

1. Check CodeBuild logs in CloudWatch
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check IAM permissions for CodeBuild role
4. Verify Docker image can be built
