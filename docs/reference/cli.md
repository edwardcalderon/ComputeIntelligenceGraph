# CLI Reference

This document describes how to use the current `@cig-technology/cli`
foundation release as it exists in the repository today.

## Purpose

The CLI is the bootstrap and operator surface for CIG. It is responsible for:

- authenticating the operator
- staging installs
- generating or requesting initial bootstrap material
- storing local session and install metadata
- reporting local status

It is not the persistent graph-maintenance process. That responsibility is
intended to move into `cig-node`.

## Supported Flows Today

### Managed mode

Supported today:

- device authorization login
- enrollment request against the API
- local node key generation
- managed connection-profile storage
- staging of runtime bundle assets into the local install directory
- initial graph snapshot capture during install, with upload when auth is available

Not supported today:

- automatic remote installation on a Linux target
- automatic `systemd` registration on the target host
- full `/api/v1/nodes/*` command-and-control lifecycle

### Self-hosted mode

Supported today:

- bootstrap token generation
- compose manifest generation
- local `docker compose up -d`
- health polling against the local stack
- local install-state persistence
- initial graph snapshot capture during install, with queued upload once local auth exists

Not supported today:

- hashed bootstrap-token persistence on the API side
- node-to-local-API runtime sync
- complete separation between stack manifest and node config manifest

## Install and Run

Install from npm:

```bash
npm install -g @cig-technology/cli
```

Or run with `npx`:

```bash
npx @cig-technology/cli login --api-url https://app.cig.lat
```

For first-time onboarding, use the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
cig setup
```

Or run the public bash installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cig.lat/install.sh | bash
```

The public installer resolves the published npm package first so the web
install path uses the same release artifact and provenance metadata as
`npm install -g @cig-technology/cli`.

If Docker Engine or Docker Compose is missing, the installer can offer to
install the Docker prerequisites automatically on supported Linux and macOS
package managers before continuing.
If Docker is already installed but the daemon is stopped, the installer can
offer to start or initialize it automatically before retrying the checks.
If Docker is installed but this shell cannot access the daemon or does not
have sudo-capable privileges, the installer tells you to rerun it from an
administrator shell or a sudo-capable account.

## Package Maintenance

The CLI package now has package-local `@edcalderon/versioning` integration for
maintainers.

From `packages/cli`:

```bash
npm run version:status
npm run version:validate
npm run version:update-readme
npm run version:bump:patch
npm run version:bump:prerelease
```

What these do today:

- `version:validate` checks package version state and fails if `README.md` is out of sync with `CHANGELOG.md`
- `version:update-readme` regenerates the `Latest Changes` block from `CHANGELOG.md`
- `version:bump:*` updates the package version without creating a commit or tag
- `scripts/release.sh` wraps this flow and keeps the public tag format as `cli-vx.y.z`

## Local Files and State

The CLI resolves paths through XDG config conventions.

Default locations:

- `~/.config/cig/credentials.json`
- `~/.config/cig/secrets.json`
- `~/.config/cig/profiles.json`
- `~/.config/cig/state.json`
- `~/.cig/install`

Storage meaning:

- `credentials.json` contains encrypted AWS/GCP reference values
- `secrets.json` contains encrypted auth tokens, bootstrap token, and node identity
- `profiles.json` contains API/control-plane connection profiles
- `state.json` contains local install metadata and service status summary
- `~/.cig/install` contains generated compose assets and staged runtime bundle files

## Command Reference

### `cig login`

```bash
cig login --api-url http://localhost:8000
```

Current behavior:

- starts device authorization
- prints verification URL and user code
- polls until approved, denied, expired, or slowed down
- stores access and refresh tokens locally
- saves a default managed-cloud profile

### `cig logout`

```bash
cig logout --api-url http://localhost:8000
```

Current behavior:

- attempts API logout
- clears stored local credentials and secrets

### `cig doctor`

```bash
cig doctor
```

Current behavior:

- checks Docker Engine
- checks Docker Compose availability
- checks free memory
- checks free disk
- checks port availability

This is currently most useful for self-hosted mode.

### `cig install`

```bash
cig install --mode managed --profile core --api-url http://localhost:8000
cig install --mode self-hosted --profile core
```

Managed mode today:

- requires working API auth and enrollment endpoints
- stages `node-runtime/config.json`
- stages `node-runtime/identity.json`
- stages `node-runtime/cig-node.service`
- writes install state locally
- seeds the initial graph snapshot and uploads it immediately when auth is present

Self-hosted mode today:

- generates bootstrap token
- writes compose files into the install directory
- starts the compose stack locally
- waits for health endpoints
- stores local install state
- seeds the initial graph snapshot locally and queues upload until auth is available

### `cig setup`

```bash
cig setup
```

Current behavior:

- runs the guided onboarding wizard
- prompts for managed vs self-hosted mode
- prompts for the install profile
- falls through to the same install engine as `cig install`
- is the recommended first-run entrypoint for operators

### `cig enroll`

```bash
cig enroll --api-url http://localhost:8000 --profile core
```

Current behavior:

- requests an enrollment token if one is not provided
- generates an Ed25519 key pair locally
- enrolls against the target API using the public key
- stores returned target identity locally

### `cig bootstrap-reset`

```bash
cig bootstrap-reset
```

Current behavior:

- generates a new bootstrap token
- stores it in the encrypted secrets store
- prints the token for operator use

### `cig connect`

```bash
cig connect aws --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CIGDiscovery
cig connect gcp --service-account ./service-account.json
cig connect api --url https://app.cig.lat --auth-mode managed
```

Current behavior:

- stores AWS and GCP references without validating remote permissions
- stores API/control-plane profiles for managed, self-hosted, or direct API use

### `cig permissions`

```bash
cig permissions
```

Current behavior:

- prints the tier model only
- does not yet request, grant, revoke, or persist permissions

### `cig status`

```bash
cig status
cig status --json
```

Current behavior:

- reads local install state
- reads the default connection profile
- prints a local summary or JSON payload

### `cig open`

```bash
cig open
```

Current behavior:

- prints the best available dashboard URL
- does not open a browser window

### `cig upgrade`

```bash
cig upgrade
```

Current behavior:

- marks the installation as stopped
- prepares for a later bundle rollout
- does not yet perform automated upgrade or rollback

### `cig uninstall`

```bash
cig uninstall
cig uninstall --purge-data
```

Current behavior:

- reads local state
- attempts `docker compose down` for self-hosted installs
- deletes local install state
- optionally removes the install directory

## Recommended Operator Flows

### Managed control plane

1. `cig login --api-url <api>`
2. `cig install --mode managed --profile core --api-url <api>`
3. Copy the staged runtime bundle from `~/.cig/install/node-runtime`
4. Materialize it on a Linux host manually until the privileged installer lands

### Self-hosted local

1. `cig doctor`
2. `cig install --mode self-hosted --profile core`
3. `cig open`
4. Complete the bootstrap flow in the dashboard

## Known Gaps

- no OS keyring backend yet
- no remote executor wiring yet
- no full host installer yet
- no real permission workflow yet
- no connector lifecycle yet
- no browser-launch behavior for `open`
- some older command output still assumes local-host defaults
