# Requirements Document: Landing Docs System

## Introduction

The Landing Docs System is a comprehensive documentation platform built with Docusaurus that serves as the central hub for CIG (Compute Intelligence Graph) project documentation. The system provides multi-language support through integration with the @cig-technology/i18n package, enables interactive diagrams via Mermaid, and deploys to multiple DNS endpoints (cig.lat/documentation and docs.cig.lat) with GitHub Pages and GCloud infrastructure support. The system operates as a monorepo application within the existing turborepo workspace.
