# Requirements Document: CIG CLI Onboarding & Installer

## Introduction

The CIG CLI Onboarding & Installer transforms the existing scaffolded CLI into a production-grade bootstrap, authentication, enrollment, and installation system. The CLI serves as the primary entrypoint for users to install, configure, and connect CIG instances to their infrastructure, supporting both managed cloud-connected deployments and self-hosted local installations.

This specification addresses the current reality: the CLI package exists with command stubs, credential management, and a basic wizard, but lacks authentication flows, enrollment systems, and actual installation logic. The goal is to build a secure, user-friendly installer that handles device authorization, target machine enrollment, Docker-based service deployment, and dashboard integration.

## Current Reality

The existing CLI implementation (packages/cli) includes:
- Commander.js framework with 8 command stubs (install, connect aws/gcp, deploy, start, stop, status, seed, reset)
- Wizard that collects deployment target, credentials, and port configuration
- CredentialManager with AES-256-GCM encryption for AWS/GCP credentials
- Docker detection and OS platform detection utilities
- TODO stubs for provision() and rollback() functions
- No authentication, enrollment, or installation implementation

The broader CIG system is 75% complete with working API (Fastify + JWT auth), dashboard (Next.js), graph engine (Neo4j), discovery services (Cartography), and Docker Compose infrastructure for 7 services.

4. Minimum 4GB RAM and 10GB disk space
5. Available ports: 3000, 7474, 7687, 8000, 8080

### Internal Dependencies

1. CIG API with JWT authentication (already implemented)
2. CIG Dashboard with Next.js (already implemented)
3. Neo4j database (already configured)
4. Docker Compose infrastructure (already defined)
5. Existing CredentialManager in packages/cli (already implemented)

### New Dependencies to Add

2. uuid - UUID generation for tokens and identities
3. ssh2 - SSH client for remote installation (v1.1)
4. qrcode-terminal - QR code generation for device authorization
5. cli-progress - Progress bars for installation steps
6. chalk - Terminal color output
7. ora - Spinner animations for loading states

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

1. **Security of device authorization flow** - Mitigation: Follow OAuth 2.0 RFC 8628 strictly, implement rate limiting, use short-lived codes
2. **Credential storage security** - Mitigation: Use AES-256-GCM with machine-specific keys, set strict file permissions (0600)
3. **Installation failures leaving system in broken state** - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive rollback, test extensively on multiple distributions

### Medium Risk

1. **Docker compatibility across distributions** - Mitigation: Test on Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, CentOS, support Docker Engine and Docker Desktop
2. **Network connectivity issues during installation** - Mitigation: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff, provide offline mode in v1.1
3. **Port conflicts with existing services** - Mitigation: Check port availability before installation, allow custom port configuration

### Low Risk

1. **User confusion with two operational modes** - Mitigation: Clear documentation, interactive prompts with explanations
2. **Performance on low-resource systems** - Mitigation: Document minimum requirements, provide core profile for minimal installations
3. **Cross-platform path handling** - Mitigation: Use Node.js path module, test on all supported platforms

## Open Questions

1. **Should we support custom Docker Compose files?** - Decision: No for v1.0, consider for v1.1 with validation
2. **Should we proxy Dashboard access through cloud API?** - Decision: No for v1.0, direct access only, consider for v2.0
3. **Should we support multiple CIG accounts per CLI?** - Decision: No for v1.0, single account only
4. **Should we implement automatic updates?** - Decision: No for v1.0, manual upgrade command only
5. **Should we support Docker Swarm or Kubernetes?** - Decision: No for v1.0, Docker Compose only
6. **Should we collect crash reports automatically?** - Decision: No for v1.0, manual bug reporting only
